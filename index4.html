                    <p class="summer__text_block2"> It’s not often that major titans in the fashion industry team up, but when they do…boy do we love it. This summer isn’t even upon us and yet, it just got a whole lot hotter with today’s announcement that Fendi and Versace are releasing
                        a collaborative Fendace collection. </p>
                    <p class="summer__text_block2"> Fendace consists of not one, but two lines: Fendi by Versace, designed by Donatella Versace, and Versace by Fendi, designed by Kim Jones. From both, you can expect a glimmering array of printed handbags, silk scarves, and logo-stamped
                        shoes and jewelry that are sure to be the objects of every collector’s desire. Fendace includes both men and women’s apparel, and will launch in Fendi boutiques and pop-up locations on Thursday, May 12. The collection previously
                        debuted in a star-studded pre-fall 2022 runway show.
                    </p>
                    <p class="summer__text_block2"> True to form for both design houses, the news came in tandem with glamorous imagery and an equally opulent video from legendary photographer Steven Meisel and filmmaker Alec Maxwell, premiering exclusively on ELLE.com. Collectively,
                        Meisel and Maxwell have worked with the likes of Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Kate Moss, Rihanna, Alexa Chung, Gigi Hadid, Oprah, and Taylor Swift. The video features Amar Akway, Anja Rubik, Imaan Hammam, Kristen McMenamy,
                        and Lina Zhang. Pat McGrath served as the makeup artist for the campaign. Take a sneak peek at the Fendace collection here, and be sure to check out the full line when it drops on May 12.
                    </p>
                    <p class="summer__text_block2">The show culminated with classic evening dresses and slinky and simple black-and-white column gowns with a cut-out here and a pop of red there to counter the headiness of the monochrome palette. Bella Hadid smiled as she sauntered
                        around the make-believe living room in a white column dress with open shoulders. To close the show, model Vittoria Ceretti donned a classic black tuxedo, along with a black bomber jacket and baseball cap, both adorned with the
                        New York Yankees logo. For a first show back, Ralph Lauren’s message was loud and clear: although certain unavoidable obstacles have prevented the brand from presenting and celebrating in person, New York is forever. </p>

                    <p class="autumn__text_block2">A prominent eveningwear trend in the collections this year were these luxe takes on the classic tuxedo. More traditional tuxes could be seen at Burberry and Dior, while less literal takes, like this skirt suit at McQueen and this tuxedo
                        dress at Saint Laurent, were elegant and sharply designed.</p>
                    <p class="autumn__text_block2">
                        We’ve moved on from the Miu Miu mini to this season’s maxi. Skirt lengths have historically yo-yoed over the years—and in 2022, we have found ourselves back to the maxi skirt, this time feeling a bit ’90s, even if the silhouettes were a bit fuller (a
                        design that we can all thank Coco Chanel for: she was the first to create a wider skirt for women in the 1920s, freeing the legs and allowing for more practicality during day-to day activities). We loved seeing this classic skirt
                        trend paired with a casual sweater or cardigan, making it super wearable for daytime.</p>

                    <p class="autumn__text_block2">
                        It felt very relevant to now—with everyone unsure about emerging after Covid—in addition to putting another layer of safety and comfort in your clothing. </p>

                    <p class="autumn__text_block2">This season, Surrealism was everywhere—with many brands translating the codes of Surrealist art directly onto their garments and painting, printing, or sculpting their garments and accessories with human body parts. Fun fact: this
                        Alexander McQueen suit was created in the same manner as the white tube dress from the legendary spring 1999 show, “Savage Beauty”—by a robot spray painter.
                        <p class="autumn__text_block2">
                            The Loewe show was entirely a surreal experience from start to finish: dresses were adorned with 3-D lips and balloons cheekily positioned on the chest, and, as seen in our favorite look here, hands caressed the body. Even emerging Central Saint Martins
                            designer Steve O. Smith was in on the trend, putting hand-painted works of art on his designs and comfort in your clothing.
